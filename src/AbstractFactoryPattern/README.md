# Abstract Factory Design Pattern in Java

## What is the Abstract Factory Design Pattern?

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows clients to create objects that follow a general pattern.

## Why Use the Abstract Factory Design Pattern?

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is used to:

- **Encapsulate Object Families:** Create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Promote Consistency:** Ensure that related objects are used together.
- **Improve Flexibility:** Abstract the process of object creation, allowing for easier maintenance and scalability.

## Real-life Use Cases of Abstract Factory Design Pattern

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is often used in:

- **GUI Toolkits:** Creating different types of widgets (e.g., buttons, scroll bars) for different operating systems.
- **Database Libraries:** Providing a way to create various database objects (e.g., connections, commands) for different database systems.
- **Document Creation Systems:** Generating documents with various formats (e.g., HTML, PDF, XML) using different sets of related objects.
