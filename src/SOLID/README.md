# SOLID Principles in Low-Level Design

## Introduction

The SOLID principles are a set of guidelines that help software developers design robust, maintainable, and scalable systems. These principles are particularly useful in low-level design (LLD) to ensure that the system architecture is well-structured and easy to understand. This repository contains examples of each SOLID principle in action.

## SOLID Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Definition:** A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

**Description:** By adhering to SRP, we ensure that each class in our system is focused on a single task. This makes the class easier to understand, test, and maintain. If a class has multiple responsibilities, changes to one responsibility can impact the others, leading to a fragile design.

**Example:** See `examples/SRPExample.java` for an implementation of SRP.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**Definition:** Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Description:** OCP encourages developers to write code that can be extended without modifying the existing source code. This is typically achieved through abstraction, allowing new functionality to be added by creating new derived classes that implement existing interfaces.

**Example:** See `examples/OCPExample.java` for an implementation of OCP.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**Definition:** Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

**Description:** LSP ensures that a subclass can stand in for its superclass without causing errors or unexpected behavior. This principle is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the inheritance hierarchy and ensuring that polymorphism works correctly.

**Example:** See `examples/LSPExample.java` for an implementation of LSP.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**Definition:** No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

**Description:** ISP promotes the creation of smaller, more specific interfaces rather than large, general-purpose ones. By doing so, we ensure that implementing classes only need to be concerned with the methods that are relevant to them, leading to a more modular and flexible design.

**Example:** See `examples/ISPExample.java` for an implementation of ISP.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Definition:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

**Description:** DIP encourages the use of dependency injection to decouple high-level and low-level components. By depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, we achieve greater flexibility and easier maintainability.

**Example:** See `examples/DIPExample.java` for an implementation of DIP.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured to provide clear examples of each SOLID principle. You can find the relevant examples in the `examples` directory:

- `examples/SRPExample.java`: Example demonstrating the Single Responsibility Principle.
- `examples/OCPExample.java`: Example demonstrating the Open/Closed Principle.
- `examples/LSPExample.java`: Example demonstrating the Liskov Substitution Principle.
- `examples/ISPExample.java`: Example demonstrating the Interface Segregation Principle.
- `examples/DIPExample.java`: Example demonstrating the Dependency Inversion Principle.

## Conclusion

By following the SOLID principles, we can create software that is easier to maintain, extend, and understand. This repository aims to provide practical examples to help you implement these principles in your own projects.

Feel free to explore the examples and use them as a reference for your own designs. Happy coding!
