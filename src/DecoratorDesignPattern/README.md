# Decorator Design Pattern in Java

## What is the Decorator Design Pattern?

The Decorator Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Why Use the Decorator Design Pattern?

The Decorator Design Pattern is used to:

- **Add Responsibilities Dynamically:** Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
- **Promote Flexibility:** Combine behaviors in a flexible and reusable way without using inheritance.
- **Enhance Functionality:** Extend the behavior of an object without altering its structure.

## Real-life Use Cases of Decorator Design Pattern

The Decorator Design Pattern is often used in:

- **GUI Frameworks:** Adding functionality like scroll bars, borders, or shadows to graphical components.
- **I/O Streams:** Java I/O libraries where streams can be decorated with additional functionalities like buffering, filtering, or compression.
- **Text Processing:** Adding functionalities such as bold, italic, or underline to text components.

## Example: Pizza with Base and Toppings

## Conclusion

The Decorator Design Pattern is a powerful tool for extending the functionality of objects in a flexible and reusable way. It is widely used in various domains, from GUI components to I/O streams, to add dynamic behavior to objects.
